Data Analysis for Dissertation Project
Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore the relationship between strike duration, industry sector, union membership, and other relevant variables. By analyzing historical strike data, we hope to identify patterns and trends that can inform labor policies and negotiations.

Data Sources
The primary data source for this project is the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which provides comprehensive data on work stoppages, including strikes and lockouts, in the United States. Additional data sources may be used to supplement the analysis as needed.

Repository Structure
data/: This directory contains the raw data files obtained from various sources.

notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis.

scripts/: This directory contains Python scripts for data processing and analysis tasks.

results/: This directory will store the output files, such as plots, reports, and other artifacts generated during the analysis.

requirements.txt: This file lists the Python packages and dependencies required for running the code in this repository.

Tasks Completed
x Obtained and preprocessed strike data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics

x Performed exploratory data analysis and visualized strike patterns

x Implemented data cleaning and feature engineering techniques

x Conducted statistical analysis to identify significant factors influencing strike duration

TODO
Incorporate additional data sources (e.g., union membership, industry-specific factors)

Develop predictive models to forecast strike duration based on various factors

Conduct sensitivity analysis and model validation

Generate comprehensive reports and visualizations for the analysis results

Write the dissertation chapter based on the analysis findings
